# QuantumShield

QuantumShield is a Zero Trust security framework that dynamically evaluates user, device, and network contexts to enforce adaptive access control.

## Features
- **Zero Trust Architecture** – Continuously verifies identity and context before granting access.
- **Risk-Based Access Control** – Uses risk scores to determine access permissions dynamically.
- **Device & Network Context Evaluation** – Ensures devices and networks meet security policies.
- **Least Privilege Enforcement** – Grants only the necessary permissions.
- **Security-Driven Automation** – Integrates enhanced controls like MFA and session monitoring.
